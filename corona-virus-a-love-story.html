    <p>And she walked into my life .. with no fanfare, silently on New Years day..</p>

<p>I have heard about her and her penchant to take over your life. I had heard that she was quick to seek many partners and suffocate their lives. Yet she was known to be scared of vaccines and masks.</p>

<p>I had taken all precautions and kept to myself. I was not really interested in her…but she came to visit. At first, it was just a temperature change .. her hotness coefficient was above the normal ..</p>

<p>Then, slowly she consumed my life. We slept together all day - coughing and coughing. She lulled me into sleep by sheer exhaustion. The food did not taste the same nor the world. Everything seemed to be out of order. </p>

<p>Sometimes she seemed to walk away and I was back at work. But then she did come back and sent shivers all over me. Her dominant attitude made me cringe and I just followed her like a puppy. </p>

<p>I thought I had my defense with my vaccination but she was smart - her cousin, omicron, sneaked in. Soon I realized, she was not alone. She had her family - delta, omicron work for her as a team..</p>

<p>People I reached out to advised wearing a mask and isolating myself. They said she was quick to make friends with the rest of the family. Before I realized, she did make friends with the family but luckily she was not interested in them. She wanted to be only with me..</p>

<p>She was not always visible and walked stealthily. Many refused to acknowledge her presence and paid a heavy price with health. She single handedly changed the world ..</p>

<p>After two weeks, she was bored of me and left the way she came in .. silently. She left behind a gift for me, even when I refused - food did not taste the same any more..</p>

<p>Today, I feel good and not worried about her anymore .. but I know she could visit anytime she chooses and that’s the power she has ..</p>
