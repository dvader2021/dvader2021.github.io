                      <p>What is life? Many definitions abound. Over the centuries, many philosophers, religious leaders, ordinary people and gurus of various stripes have dipped their quills in ink, bent over their manuscripts, and tried to come up with a satisfactory answer. Perhaps you’re asking yourself the same question right now like me. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bob Geldof said: “The purpose of life is life itself” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Life is something that happens to us – intimately, personally. Instead of accepting and living it, we are guilty of chasing something thinking it is life. We spend our time chasing and dreaming of what life should be that we fail to see the true significance of what it actually is. </p>

<p>We chase with a earnestness and a desire that goes like ..</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In his youth, he chased the dream job <br />
  Other time, he raced for the beautiful girl with a bob <br />
  Planning to live someday when he had his time to lob <br />
  Forgetting the present, he was riding the future cob <br />
  Now a dad, he constantly cared <br />
  Worrying about his children all day, he prayed <br />
  His life only revolved around them and not shared <br />
  Eclipsed by the shadow of his family, change he not dared <br />
  Now lying pale on his death bed <br />
  He realized a little too late instead <br />
  He had died long back, <br />
  life that he never lived nor led <br />
  Today, only his body was getting ready for the heavenly bed  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have to accept that life is not a chase. Instead, embrace it as it is. If we start chasing all the time, then it’s probable that life is something we are looking to escape from.</p>

<p>Life is living - being in the moment; experiencing it every second every day. It is not about butchering life from our concepts of good, bad, wrong or right. It is to simply live with what’s transpiring before our eyes right now with no judgement.</p>

<p>Life is a journey with full of unexpected twists and turns and with no specific plan. We suffer because we compare reality to our wishes and expectations which don’t mirror each other. We spend much of our time judging ourselves, others and situations based on what we expect them to be. If it rains when we least expect it, we become unhappy. We are constantly looking for new ways to be disappointed fixating on petty wishes, coveting a new car, a dream home or a perfect complexion.  We forget that life is under no obligation to do anything for us.</p>

<p>Instead of being aware of the present moment and cherishing it, we succumb to temptations and feel disappointed and stressed. </p>

<p>All these wishes and expectations are like a veil between us and reality. They keep us from experiencing that cool rain as anything else then the frustrating absence of the weather we expected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead, we should accept everything - the pain, the happiness, the disappointment, the failure, the success and everything that goes with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Life doesn’t remember yesterday nor has plans for tomorrow. It is just as it is. There is no one person sitting somewhere controlling everything. So, let us stop blaming the universe.</p>

<p>Uncertainty abounds in life. Almost a giant probability model. This uncertainty shapes our world and produces an image of chaos and negativity, making the world seem wrapped in fear and anxiety. Additionally, the pressures imposed by society and its expectations regarding anything we can't touch, feel or see takes away our ability to feel comfortable inside ourselves. Instead of uncertainty making us panic, It should invigorate us. Instead of worrying about the monsters that might be lurking in corners, we should focus on all the amazing things awaiting discovery. Tools like meditation can help bring calm and create room for our inner voice to speak to us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The moment to live is only now <br />
  Finding the balance between your desire and throw <br />
  Walking the line between contentment and sorrow <br />
  Experiencing the pain and pleasure in the field narrow <br />
  The truth is visible to absorb and grow <br />
  Today is the only sun you may see flow <br />
  This hard truth is not difficult to perceive or show <br />
  Change is the river that washes to flow <br />
  Leaving nothing but memories that crow <br />
  Be at peace, all will pass and not grow <br />
  The pain, the joy, the money and even your estate and dough <br />
  Wear the apron of contentment and sow <br />
  bask in sunshine of happiness and glow <br />
  Without letting go the hope of a sunny arrow <br />
  While continuing to play the game of your destiny fashion show  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let it go - on a more philosophical note, everything will pass. </p>

<p>We often wake up every morning thinking about the past - the mistakes made, the regrets, carry forward anger, self-abuse and a litany of other feelings long gone. Even if those negative feelings only happened yesterday, our emotional fitness is immediately compromised the minute we wake up to a new day. Emotional fitness means clearing the mind of these negative thoughts so that we can cut through the clutter and achieve balance. Learning to let go is a tool for achieving emotional fitness.</p>

<p><strong>We forget that we humans are but an inconspicuous grain in an obscure corner of a galaxy which itself is one of the 200+ Billion galaxies in the visible universe</strong>. A dimension and size that is too large and difficult to even comprehend. Our life span is minuscule compared to the time scale of the universe. In all, everything we do and say is so insignificant that we should learn to “let go” .. to lead a good life for that short period of time that we are alive and conscious.</p>
