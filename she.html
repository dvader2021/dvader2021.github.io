<p>She walked into my life - unannounced, bouncing from a photo into my life. We met for few minutes and she decided to marry me .. I stood flabbergasted .. not at the decision but the trust that she implied in me .. an unknown stranger .. and only because our families agreed that this was right .. this is the 90s .. arranged marriages were still in vogue ..</p>
<p>The relationship started on a high note. Her personality intrigued me. Her charm, her smile, her eyes  and just everything about her enveloped my life. Simply said, I walked mesmerized at her positive attitude towards life. </p>
<p>I enjoyed the immense attention that she gave me. The romance was in full bloom. We got married and she moved in with me. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>letting the moment pause and linger<br>
feeling the music, the deep silence renders<br>
the two hearts drenched in love tender <br>
take their tale of love into the woods under  </p>
<p>stay silent, don’t say anything now<br>
feel the moment<br>
perk your ears<br>
hear the sound, the whisper of love  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relationships works in cycles .. they start out with romance ..being enchanted with the person, they progress into conflict .. getting to see the darker side of each other, and then repose in commitment .. being able to accept everything as it is.</p>
<p>I was lax in building on this initial euphoria. I never discussed anything significant .. likes, dislikes, interests, career, family. It was all fun and frolic. Yet we quickly realized we were two diametrically opposite personality. Our ideas of life and living clashed. Soon silly fights over even insipid reasons started creeping in.  The relationship craved for the missing nurturing - tender and caring to let it grow and cement forever .. to work out the conflict into commitment. </p>
<p>The bedrock of any healthy relationship is mutual acceptance. When we find someone who loves us with all our faults and emotional burdens we feel liberated. She embraced me while I stood unattached. It was time to pause and fix it .. the signs were everywhere. I just walked past it ignorant.</p>
<p>Sometimes relationships need an outside perspective to provoke and flush the flaws out. I was locked in my cocoon and did not let any outside view interfere. Even the few who dared to step in only succeeded in amplifying the dent. The many simple dents remained untended and became an unruly chasm in time. </p>
<p>Mundane life events took over the reins and forced us to move forward. Kids, house, career .. everything kept the relationship flame flickering and alive .. although lipid and dull. The underlying issues popped their head now and then. And when they did pop, it seemed violent and totally uncivilized. I could hear the choicest adjectives attached to my name. There was lot of ugly language, yelling and puerile insinuations. I got blamed for everything in her life including her marriage to me. I'm not sure how much said was real and how much came in the heat of the moment. But they continued chipping into the thin glue that held this relationship together. Relationships asks us to let go of the desire to be right in arguments, and instead search for compromise. I did not make this happen. Anger and frustration shut down the rational part of my brain. There were no apologies, no sorry's. It just got pushed into the corner under the drapes of sex. </p>
<p>Ultimately, relationship requires allowing life and love to be just what they are – with all their sorrow, ecstasy, and heartache – without trying to take control. This is what it takes to be present in a relationship - to love and to be loved. I thoroughly failed in seeing this reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even as we face each other<br>
our minds stay far away<br>
Sounds of my whisper arrive as words of anger to you <br>
In the darkness, you read my face, that I never intend to portray<br>
Slowly collecting tears to ease the walk into new  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then it happened .. suddenly and with a bang. She walked out. The relationship finally collapsed under its own weight. </p>
<p>And then realization walked in. The many previously flashing signs came back to haunt and remind. Unfortunately, Life like time only moves forward. No matter how much you regret and cry, you will not be able to bring the past back. There is no “back to the future” to erase and restart. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>my sagacious mind wants to let go<br>
the irresponsible me holds to you tight<br>
this tug of war has no real ending<br>
leaving my life seesawing in muddled light  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast forward few months .. it was time to accept, let go, forgive and move forward. The natural response to a painful experience like this is to obsess over what happened. It’s all too common to replay such painful scenarios in our minds for months, even years. But forgiving ourselves and others is a must to move forward. </p>
<p>She walked out .. leaving behind a newer, wiser and a better person than when she found me … for that, I remain forever grateful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Staring into the vacuum<br>
Hanging onto sweet memories<br>
Watching the skin glow and wrinkle<br>
in the arms of time, lie me and your memories  </p>
</blockquote>
