<p><strong>* why write a blog? *</strong>  </p>

<p>Life happens <br />
Many thoughts race into action <br />
Some real, some imagination <br />
Some dark, some funny and some with no situation <br />
Some random, some with a home and a mansion <br />
I imprisoned those thoughts with my pen <br />
Grabbing it while I can and making it stay in my den <br />
Giving it a shape, molding with a tape and forcing it to wear my apron <br />
For you my reader to discard, silently watch or relive the action </p>

<p><strong>* Tell me more about the author *</strong> </p>

<p>Who am I? <br />
A question that you ask <br />
How do I respond? <br />
an answer that wears many mask  </p>

<p>In the eyes of the society <br />
I’m a writer, a technologist <br />
A father, a son <br />
The many faces that I’m asked to wear <br />
For different occasions, time and fun  </p>

<p>In the journey of life <br />
playing the game of probability <br />
holding a beacon of hope <br />
under the clouds of dreams <br />
I’m navigating a path soft, squishy and uneven   </p>

<p>In the expanse of the cosmos <br />
In the realms of distance <br />
In the arms of time <br />
I’m a speck of dust <br />
Tiny, insignificant and yet unique   </p>
