    <p>The door slammed shut <br />
Out walked the man yelling and cursing <br />
Unknown to him, two little innocent eyes <br />
Watched him go unaware of the bruising  </p>

<p>Ignorant was the little one <br />
Running to his mother for comfort <br />
In her own little apprehension <br />
She pushed him away offering zero consolation  </p>

<p>Returning to his room, he cried aloud <br />
Tears rained down his cheeks like water on sty <br />
His mind raced with many unanswered questions <br />
the little one had no one to hear his cry  </p>

<p>Suddenly the child woke with a start his head dizzy <br />
His cozy world collapsing around him cold <br />
Words failed to emit from the tender lips <br />
Life that he was familiar with had no more hold  </p>

<p>The image of a family dinner around the fire <br />
The hand of a father ruffling the hair on his head <br />
The hug from a mother providing the warmth <br />
All vanished with no reason that he could fathom instead  </p>

<p>His still teary eyes refused to stop dripping <br />
When hunger crunched his stomach in pain <br />
He staggered to look around for someone he knew <br />
There was only pitch darkness for him to see in vain  </p>

<p>No one was nearby to hear him sob <br />
Nor put a comforting hand on his shoulder <br />
No one was there to tell him to fight <br />
Absolute hollowness engulfed him like a solid boulder  </p>

<p>The life size ego of the adult <br />
Tore apart the tender heart sending a shiver <br />
Deep down his mind and the soul <br />
Their actions etched a scar to linger forever  </p>
